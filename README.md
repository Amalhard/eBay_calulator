# eBay_calulator
A basic profit calculator that can be adjusted according to variable selling fees + discounts + promotion fees

I began this small project about 2 years ago and abandoned it. Back then it was just a heap of variables and inputs and a few operators to
come up with the profits minus the various deductions. Today it feels a bit more cohesive, through the use of functions.
I will continue to improve on it and hopefully at some point get a round to adding a GUI.
